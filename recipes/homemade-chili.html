    <h2>This homemade chili is loaded with beef, beans, and crowd-pleasing flavor</h2>
    <p>"So simple," says BajaGirl61. "This is going to be my 'go-to' chili recipe from now on. Basic chili — but very good. I prepped the night before and had my husband throw it in the Crock-Pot for a couple of hours before I got home from work."</p>
    <p>"Simple ingredients with awesome flavor," raves Patrick Longton. "I only changed one thing and that is I used a dark lager beer instead of water. Pure comfort food!"</p>
